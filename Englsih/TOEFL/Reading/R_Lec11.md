### Passage

The Tang Dynasty was influential in spreading Chinese traditions throughout the Far East, particularly in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Inspired by the empire's wealth and power, neighboring countries began to study and borrow cultural elements in the hopes of using them to their own advantange. For example, literary Chines and its script became the language of government used by elites in all three countries.

### Passage

The first paintings were murals. Murals could not be detached, but later, the technique of painting on panels was developed. Panel paintings were done on single pieces of wood or thin stripes that were pieced together. These creations were portable and could thus be easily moved. In the fourteenth century, painters began using canvases. Made of fabric, canvases wers lightweight, so they were easy to work with and transport. The surface of canvases held paint much better than did wood, and it was not prone to warping and cracking. However, the woven fabric affected the texture of the painting in a way that Renaissance artists disliked. Therefore, they went to great lengths to smooth the surface of the painting so that it had a glossy finish, much like that of photograph.

### Passage

A timberline is the line or elevation at which trees are unable to grow on mountains. From a distance, these tree lines may appear easily distinguishable, but upon closer examination, observers can clearly discern that the transitions are actually gradual. Trees closer to the line are shorter or even stunted, and those closest to the line look like clumps of bushes.

Environmental conditions such as temperature, amount of sunlight, the direction of the wind, air pressure, and absence of moisture determine the location of the upper and lower timberlines. However, some mountains are not uniformly subject to the same conditions.

1. One side of a mountain may have greater exposure to sunlight and thus have a higher timberline;
2. the one in the shaded area will be lower.

### Passage

In 1808, US Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin recommended that the government provide funds for the construction of roads and other transport systems across the nation, but the proposition failed to get enough votes in COngress. It was not until the War of 1812 with Britain that officials realized the country was in desperate need of roads. Troops stationed in the West were needed at the battlefront, but because of the lack of adequate transportation networks, military leaders found moving them to be a painfully slow process.

A solution came in the form of privately built roadways called turnpikes, which were maintained by private companies hoping to earn big profits by charging a toll for their use. These early toll roads, often established along stagecoach routes, were predecessors to modern highways and interstate systems, and most were eventually taken over by state highway departments in the twentieth century.

### Passage
1단락 -> 철새 비행 : 매번 비슷한 경로

1.Some birds are permanent residents and either have adapted to survival in winter habitats or inhabit areas where temperatures are relatively stable, such as near the equator. Nonetheless, many bird species living in seasonally inhospitable environments are seasonal residents. As winter is often the most challenging time for birds to access indispensable needs like food, shelter, and water, many escape the conditions by migrating more suitable habitats as the days become shorther and temperatures drop in autumn.

2단락 -> 철새 비행 가설 (1) Star Compass

2.Scientists have proposed two interrelated hypotheses for how this navigation may be achieved. The first(가설1) is the theory that birds have internal star compasses. According to the theory, birds use the locations and spacing of stars, as well as their regular movements, to determine direction. Experimenting with indigo buntings in the 1970s, American ornithologist Stephen Emlen used a planetarium to simulate the night sky. Emlen put the birds in funnel-shaped cages so that the only visible direction was up. At the bottom of the cages he placed a wet ink pad and covered the walls with paper, Emlen was able to trace the movements of the birds within the enclosures and confirm that the buntings altered their courses consistently in relation to the movement of stars.

3단락 -> 철새 비행 가설 (2) Magnetic Field

Complicating this theory, however, is the fact that birds continue to navigate effectively at night under cloud cover, when no stars are clearly visible.(가설 1 적용 X). Magnetic-compass theory(가설 2) which asserts birds use magnetic fields to determine their location, is an attempt to explain how birds can continue to navigate without visual clues. Recent research indicates that birds have minute quantities of iron oxides in their heads and beaks. These magnetic crystals align north likr needles of a compass regardless of changes in a bird's orientation, giving birds a constant flow of directional information to the brain

4단락 -> 철새 이동 자극 = zugunruhe (선천적 충동)

In studying how birds navigate, scientists also unwittingly received cues about the inclination of birds to migrate. When nocturnal migrants were kept in cages at night, they demonstrated restless behavior, as if they were involuntarily being pulled in their normal migratory direction. zungunruhe, a term derived from the German roots meaning migeration and anxiety. It is believed that birds have an innate impulse to migrate, which is universal among bird species, though much subdued in non-migratory populations.
