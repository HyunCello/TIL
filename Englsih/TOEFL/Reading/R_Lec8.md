## Hackers Test 2 #1

1. The word "remarkably" in the passage is closest in meaning to

    c. surprisingly

단락 1 -> At fist glance, fish appear to have poorly developed hearing. Their absence of external ears and lack of an eardrum or tube connecting the auditory organs with the outside world would seem to indicate that fish have ears that are not well-equipped to detect sound vibrations moving through water. However, biologists have found the auditory system of fish to be remarkably sensitive.

2. According to paragraph 2, all of the following have a major influence on a fish's ability to hear EXCEPT


3. The word "interpret" in the passage is closest in meaning to

    D. decipher 해석하다

단락 2 -> Many higher vertebrates likke mammals have outer and middle ears, but fish do not. Fish only have inner ears. The fish ear is divided into upper and lower sections. The upper, or dorsal, section is the pars superior, which is subdivided into three semicircular canals. Filled with fluid and sensory hairs, these canals detect gravity and also give fish their sense of balance. Without the pars superior, fish would be confined to judging their vertical orientation in the water on the basis of light coming from the surface. However, ichthyologists believe the upper portion of the ear serves only a minor role in sound detection. It is lower section, the pars inferior, (보기 B) which serves as the integral instrument in receiving auditory signals. Sound waves that reach the pars inferior pass through a solid receprive structure called an otolith, or "ear stone," (보기 A) which is lined with tissue connecting the otolith with sensory hair cells. (보기D) Sound waves cause the otolith to vibrate, thus exciting sensory hair cells and activating sensory neurons of the auditory nerve. Fish interpret signals sent along the auditory nerve as "hearing" once the signals reach the brain.

4. The word "significantly" in the passage is clisest in meaning to

    A. considerably 상당히

단락 3 -> All known fish species can detect the motion of sound particles in the ear, but some have developed peripheral specializations that enhance their auditory capacities. Fishes with these specializations are called hearing specialists, and fishes without such specializations are called hearing generalists. Most hearing generalists detect sound in a low-frequency range, from below 30 Hz ti around 1,000 Hz. Specialists can detect sound in a much greater range. The American shad, for instance, can sense ultrasonic frequencies of up to 180,000 Hz. This is significantly more sensitive than human hearing, where 20,000 Hz is the approximate upper limit for natural sound detection in the average adult.

5. The phrase "adjacent to" in the passage is closest in meaning to

    B. nearby ~가까이의, ~에 인접한

6. According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of the gas bladder?



단락 4 - A notable example of a hearing specialization is in fishes that have a gas bladder  adjacent to the ears. The gas bladder is an organ used to control a fish's buoyancy that has a density far below that of the body or the surrounding water. The American shad has gas tubes that directly connect the gas bladder to the ear. In catfish and carp, the gas bladder is indirectly connected to the ear by modified vertebrae. Due to the density variances, sound pressure waves can easily compress the gas within the bladder, causing the bladder to rhythmically expand and contract. These pulsations can then be transmitted to the ear. The gas bladder is thus believed to play a central role in sound reception in many fishes. Studies of Atlantic cod have clearly shown that the presence of the gas bladder results in heightened sensitivity to sound, especially at high frequencies. Using a hypodermic needle to deflate the gas bladder, and audiograms to chart the results, scientists were able to confirm that the cod's sensitivity to sound pressure was reduced, and the frequency range of audible sounds was limited, when the bladder was emptied.

7. Accordung to paragraph 5, what is a possible impact of noise in oceans?

8. The word "urge" in the passage is closest in meaning to

    A. encourage 촉구하다

단락 5 - Understanding that fish have a more sensitive auditory system than was previosly thought, marine scientists have begun to discuss the potential effects of increased noise in the oceans. Since the 1970s, the noise level in the Earth's waters has risen by more than ten percent. Boats, barges, and oil drills all inject sound vibrations into the water, and recent studies have shown that the noises can damage the ears of fish. In responsive to the finfdings, scientists have begyn to urge people to be cautious when making sound in marine environments.
