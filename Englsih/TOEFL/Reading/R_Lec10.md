# Reference 유형 소개

- 음영 지시어가 가리키는 대상 찾기

- 앞에서 사용된 단어를 똑같이 반복하는 대신 사용된 '대명사'로 출제 (업)

- 지문당 0 - 1개 출제

- 난이도 : 중 - 하

- 문제 예시 :

The word/phrase "A" in the passage refers to

## 전략(1) 정답은 지시어와 가까운 앞!

- (음영 지시어 기준) 같은 문장 앞 절, 앞 문장 1개에서 찾기

- 우선순위 : "음영 지시어"와 가까운 명사일 확률

    -> 멀어져 봐야 앞 문장 1개!

- 고른 보기를 음영 자리에 삽입해서 서술부까지 해석 점검!

## 전략(2) 지시어와 정답은 문장 속 역할이 대부분 같다!

- 문장 성분이 같은 것끼리 매칭하기

- 지시어가 **주격**이면 -> 정답도 지시어 앞 부분의 주어 / 주체

- 지시어가 목적격이면 -> 정답도 지시어 앞 부분의 목적어 / 객체

## 전략(3) 지시어와 정답은 서술부 의미가 같다!

- 앞 절 / 앞 문장 명사들 중 뒤 문장 "음영 지시어와" 수식어(형용사), 동사부 의미가 같은 명사 = 정답!

- Tip : 보통 정답 = 음영 지시어는 그 문장의 keyword로 자주 출제!

## 전략(4) 기타 빈출포인트

1. 관계대명사 which

- comma(쉼표) 가 없이 + which 가 바로 연결 되었을 때

    -> 앞 선행사가 명사가 정답

- comma(쉼표) 있고 + which 연결 되었을 때

    -> 같은 문장 속 앞 명사들 = 모두 후보!
    -> which 뒤 서술부를 먼저 해석하고 서술부 의미가 일치하는 명사 1개 고르기

2. 지시대명사 / 인칭대명사

- 단수 : this, that, the former, the letter / it, she, he

- 복수 : these, those / they, them, their

3. 병렬 구조

- 소유격 병렬 : Jack's book is similar to that of Jane.

- 비교급 병렬 : He went down from higher level to lower one

4. 부정대명사

- some(most) + 복수 명사        others = other + 복수 명사

    Some students are nice but others(= other students) are not so good.

- one + 단수 명사               another = another + 단수 명사

    I finished one vocabulary book. I need to study another(= another v. book).

- all + 명사                    none = no + 명사

    All babies are cure. None(= No babies) are ugly.

전략 2. 정답 - 지시어

The word "their" in the passage refers to

-> (C) youths

By the seventh century BC, Greeks had learned the art of carving stone from the Egyptians and were making statues from marble, known as kouroi. These life-size sculptures depicted nude, male youths with fists at their sides and left foot put forward.

Trout are a popular food and game fish that belong to the salmon family. Although most are known to live entirely in fresh waters and streams, several varieties, known as sea trout, enter the ocean when they are about a year old and return upstream to spawn in their original freshwater habitats about two to five years later.

Rare minerals, such as gemstones, have great commercial value due to their beauty and limited supply. Since the demand for gemstones is high but their availability is finite, exploration companies must work diligently to find new deposits before their competitors. The most successful of them draw upon a wide array of elaborate technologies to aid in theie quest.

Tornadoes are violent and destructive windstorms that occur more frequently in the United States than in any other country. Striking predominatly in Tornado Alley, a stretch of land from Texas to North Dakota, twisters are powerful enough to toss vehicles into the air and collapse structures. They average about sixty meters in diameter, but can stretch as far as 1.6 kilometers wide.

Bat parasites are organisms that primarily feed off of bat blood but will bite humans, birds, and rodents if the usual hosts are unavailable. The places most likely to be infested are the roosting sites of bats. Some are located in attics, unused chimneys, and empty wall spaces. If these sites are destroyes, the parasites will seek other food sources.

The first electric form of communication was the telefraph, a simple machine developed in 1828 by Harrison Dyar, which sent electrical sparks through wires that would burn a series of dots and dashes on chemically treated paper. These dots and dashes were a basic code that could be .......

A free market economy has always existed in practice where people have exchanged goods or services without government intervention, but it was in the eighteenth century when free market ideology first became a part of political theory. Based closely on the French slogan laissez-faire, which means "allow to do," it was centered on the belief that governments should not attempt to control markets, but allow buyers and sellers to determine prices on their own.

Considered one of the most intelligent animals on Earth, dolphins are studied to determine the nature of their mental abilities. Researchers are drawn to this marine mammal because it engagees in behaviors that appear to have no clear purpose - leaping above the water surface in an acrobatic spin, for example. Scientists do not know if this is functional or for recreational enjoyment. Another unusual behavior is the dolphin's tendency to act in a social way toward other living beings. They often interact playfully with human swimmers in the ocean or in a pool.

Infants are quick to distinguish their mothers' voices from the voices of other people. This was determined in a 1980 study conducted by developmental psychologists DeCasper and Fifer, who observed that and infant's response to familiar and unfamiliar voices is, in fact, learned even before birth. Canadian nursing professor Dr. Barbara Kisilevsky reached this conclusion in 2003 after testing how fetuses responded to an (one) audiotape of their own mother reading a poem and another of a female stranger reading the same poem. Their heart rates accelerated faster when they heard their mothers' voices, indicating their ability to differentiate between the two.

Whereas the arctic tundra encircles the North Pole and extends to the coniferous forests of the upper nothern latitudes, the alpine tundra may be found all around the world in areas of high altitudes. Both are characterized by harsh conditions: the arctic tundra is cold and desert-like; the alpine is dry ad windy. Surprisingly, a large variety of animals is able to survive in both types of tundra, developing additional layers of fat to do so. Hundreds of kinds of plants also thrive in the tundra, but none (of the plants) are taller than a few feet.
