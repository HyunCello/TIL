## 2단락

=> First put forth by the Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider in his 1958 book *The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations,* attribution theory presumes that all human behavior is motivated by internal or external factors. Accordingly, human judgements about causality will reflect this by internal-external paradigm and result in a perceived dichotomy between the individiual and the world. When a person feels like a situation is outside his or her control, he or she will fell a diminished sense of responsibility. For instance, if a typically punctual employee shows up at work late due to a random traffic jam, the tensency is to project causal responsibility outward. This external attribution of cause is referred to as *situational attribution*. On the other hand, if a person feels he or she has direct influence on the outcome of some event, the person is likely to feel a sense of responsibility. Studying hard for an exam, training diligently for soccer match, and doing one's best to be a good parent all may be viewwd as stemming from a person's internal characteristics. In such cases, people will describe their own efforts and personalities as the cause of their behaviors. Psychologists refer to this explanation as *dispositional attribution*

## 3단락

=> While it is easy to attribute unexpected events to external forces, the line between a situational and dispositional attribution is often not so clear. Imagine a situation in which a person is seen engaged in a passionate dispute. If the person, or actor, is speaking in a raised voice or talking on an aggressive posture, a casual observer is likely to think the actor is prone to anger, or even naturally irrational or mean-spirited. Such an attribution often happens instantaneoulsy without consideration for the overall framework in which the argument arose. The observer assumes that the observed behavior is the sole result of the actor's personality. This tendency for observers to emphasize the dispositional, as opposed to the situational, reasons for behavior is known as correspondence bias. Now imagine the same scenario from a first-person perspective. The actor may feel as if he or she has been the victim of some extreme injustice, and that his or her behavior is a justified reaction of self-defense. The discrepancy between how people interpret their own behavior and that of others is known as actor-observer bias.

(D) ignore the link between the environment and their problems

## 4단락

A similar tendency, termed self-serving bias, can also be seen in the different reactions people have to their own positive and negative experiences. When individuals have a positive experience-for example, getting a promotion, publishing a book, or achieving goals-people view themselves as agent and are inclined to associate success with their own efforts. In contrast, when people undergo negative experiences, the bias is inverted, and they are likely to ascribe unsuccessful results to situational factors. Rather than assigning failure to personality faults, lack of ability, or insufficient effort, people magnify the factors outside their control. By mentally casting responsibility outward, people are able to blame the environment or others for their misfortunes and maintain the perception of themselves as victims of circumstance.
