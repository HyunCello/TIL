## Script

P : You all probably know tha t Johannes Gutenberg contributed much to the technology of paintng...(=업적) including to the invention of the mechanical printing press And he developed(=업적) an oil-ink just for his printing press. Water-based ink has the advantage of drying quickly, but oil ink is sticker, so it attaches to the metal blocks more effectively. What I want to focus on today, though, are the inventions that came before Gutenberg's printing press, that were stepping stones to it. So... can anyone think of an invention that helped make the printing press possible?

S : Well, this may sound silly, but the letters in printed books are small, and my grandma couldn't read until we got her a pair of reading glasses. Perhaps the invention of eyeglasses was a stepping stone?

P : Yes, it's true that books became more popular after eyeglasses were invented and made it possible for many people to see small print. But there's a major invention that preceded the printing press, and Gutenberg is widely considered to be its inventor... metal movable type...

P : It's a system of printing that uses detachable pieces, each of which represents a letter, punctuation mark, or character. It was unquestionably an improvement on the woodblock method already in use in Europe. That method of priting used a block of wood. The wood was cut away and what was left behind formed the characters or image to be printed. It was first developed in Asia, but Europeans used the woodblock method to print images on cloth. Anyhow...

P : so movable type is certainly more durable than woodblock. But...did Gutenberg really invent movable type?

S : Hmm... I'm going to say yes. I mean, before him, they had scribes who copied documents by hand, right?

P : You know what? The Chinese would be suprised to hear your response. They were using a system of movable characters about 400 years before Gutenberg developed his own version in AD 1450.

P : Let me point out that, although the Chinese invented movable type, woodblock printing was certainly better suited for Chinese writing system, which consists of more than 40,000 characters. A woodblock could be used again and again to reproduce a page of text or entire scroll. But if you used movable type, just think of how time-consuming it'd be to rearrage tens of thousands of mobile metal characters in order to print something... What a tedious task that would have been!

P : The Chinese inventor Bi Sheng created the first movable-type system in AD 1040. His type was made of baked clay. He took an iron plate and set his clay types Close together, and when the frame was full, he had one solid block of type. He heated up the plate to make it warm. The warmed-up plate softened the clay. Then Bi Sheng took a smooth board and pressed it onto the clay types so that they would all be of the same height. He then inked his clay types and pressed them on paper. When he wasn't using them, he wrapped them in paper and stored them carefully.

P : If they needed to be used again, they had to be reset on the iron plate and reheated. Now, Bi Sheng's clay types were fragile, so ti wasn't practical to apply them to large-scale printing jobs. Actually, metal movable type was first created in Korea in the 13th century... But in fairness to Gutenberg, he invented the molds that allowed for mass production of individual pieces of metal type, with each character on a seperate block. Before this, each piece of metal type had to be indiviually carved by hand.
