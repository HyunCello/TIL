# Script

P : In the last lecture, I talked about the various traits that allow animals such as camels to survive in desert ecosystems. For example, we discussed how they almost never perspire... even in high temperatures. This, uh, ensures that they don't waste bodily fluids and increases the length of time they can go without water. Today's topic isn't too different -- it's another reaction to environmental conditions, a certain type of response that's unique to only a few animals. In short, hibernation.

P : Now, it's important that you don't confuse hibernation with dormancy... They are actually quite different. I'll give a few examples to help clarify what I mean. So, when you think about hibernation, what's the prototypical animal you think of? Bears, right? So what do bears do during winter? Are they passd out in a cave for four or five months straight? Not exactly. Bears will get up occasionally -- every few days or so -- and they'll have a bite to eat, you know... and they'll go to the bathroom and, oh, yeah, the feamles will even give birth to their cubs! Also, a bear's temperature will only drop from around 38 degrees to about 34.

P : This is too minor a change to be considered hibernation, so it's incorrect when people say that bears hibernate... they actually enter a state of dormancy, which is like very deep sleep. During this dormant period, bears are able to conserve energy because their heart rates are lowered and their metabolisms are suppressed.

Also, reptiles like turtles and snakes... even though it seems like they hibernate, they don't. However, the reason that they cannot be considered hibernators is different from the one I gave for bears.

P : You see, to hibernate, an animal need to be able to control its body temperature... it's got to be warm-blooded. Snakes and turtles are cold-blooded, so their body temperature is determined by the environment around them--ut flucturates.

Let's go back and compare the bear to an animal that really hibernates, like a sauirrel. When the squirrel hibernates... even though it is a warm-blooded creature, its body temperature falls very low. In extremely cold climates, this means a squirrel's temperature might reach one or two degrees below freezing!

P : Strongely enough, squirrels warm up during their hibernation every 15 or 20 days, usually staying awake for less than a day. And just like the bears, they'll go to ther bathroom and maybe eat something. During hibernation, though, animals typically live off of their fat reserves. They'll eat and eat and eat as winter approaches, fatten up, and then burn the fat over the winter for energy to keep alive.

Another big difference between "deep sleeers" like the bear and hibernators like the squirrel is their awareness when hibernating.

P : If there's some sort of emergency, the bear can wake up immediately and respond. This is why bears are dangerous, even when they're dormant -- we know not to call it hibernation now, right? So don't mess around with tne, because they can awaken very easily... and you don't want that. In contrast, the squirrel is deat to the world when it hibernates... It takes several hours for it to awaken when it goes through its occasional warming-up phases.
