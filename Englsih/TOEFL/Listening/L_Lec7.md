# Script

W : Hi. May I help you with something?

M : Yeah, um, this is the listening lab, right?

W : Yep! What do you need?

M : Well, you see, I'm in Spanish 105 and my teacher gave us an assignment three or four weeks ago to watch some movie ... I can't remember the title ... *Los* something, I think ... I know it's about, um, well, it's based on Mexican rituals.

W : It sounds like what you're looking for is *Los Ojos de Dios*. Am I right?

M : Wow, impressive! How did you know that?

W : We've had quite a lot of students coming in this week to view it. Apparently there is some, uh, some test or something next week, right?

M : Actually, the test is at the end of this week. That means I have only three days to watch the movie. We have to write an essay on the plot of the film ... and the essay counts for, like, one-third of the grade. I'm really pushing the limits this time!

M : Well, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news. Ther was a problem with the TV/VCR, so you won't be able to view any tapes today. It seems to have been eating all of the videos.

M : What? That can't be ... When will it be available again?

W : We sent it in to the technical services department earlier this afternoon, which means it should be back sometime tomorrow around, oh, midday or so. We tried to fix it ourselves, but, well ... we're just part-time workers, you know. So we don't really have the technical know-how to deal with that kind of thing.

M : So then I can come in tomorrow afternoon or early evening and view the tape?

W : Uh-huh. Wait! I'm sorry ... I should mention that there are four other students on the waiting list. They will get first priority. so if they show up tomorrow, there may not be any time slots open. But you never know if the students will come or not. Either way, it may be worth checking back ... Who knows, you might just get lucky.

M : OK. I'll try that. But just in case, are there any other possibilities? My test is in three days and I absolutely must see this film to pass. What do you recommend that I do?

W : Well, you have a couple of options. The first is to try your luck waiting around until the TV/VCR is available, If it isn't back on time, well, that could present a problem ... Another option is to see if it is at any of the local video stores. I mean, one of the rental shops has to have it. The only problem might be that other students got the same idea ... and in that case, it might already be rented out. You could also look online to see if it's available for download.

M : Oh, right. Actually, one of my friends works at the rental shop down on Washington Street, so he might be able to help me out. If that doesn't work, I'll check online. I really appreciate your help and advice.

W : No problem ... I'm just doing my job.
