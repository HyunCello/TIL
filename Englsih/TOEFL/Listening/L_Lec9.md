# Script

OK... until the end of ther 15th century, all painters followed the same basic rules. They placed the main subject of the painting in the foreground... usually, a person. The background included less important elements... decorative items like a vase of flowers, for example. But in the 16th  century, Dutch artists began making these objects the focus of their paintings. This new form of art was called still life...

The rise of this style of painting occured during a period of exploration in European history. Um, and the Americans in the 16th century. After they returned, they published books that included detailed visual depictions of items from these regions. As a result, many artists came to appreciate the beauty of objects. They began playing attention to how they rendered these objects in paintings... often moving them to the foreground in place of human subjects. *Butcher's Stall with the Flight into Egypt* is a good example of this trend.

P : This painting was completed in 1551 by the Dutch artist Peter Aertsen. Here... take a look at the picture on the screen. What do you notice about it?

S1 : Um, it's mostly just dishes, pieces of meat, and, uh, tools... What you would expect to see in any butcher's shop, I guess.

P : Exactly, The foreground is filled with specific and detailed objects... and the people are in the background. Soon artists began leaving people out of their paintings altogeter.

P : This is where we get the term still life, actually... it comes from the fact that a painting's subjects art not alive.

Now, in the early 17th century, the Dutch Republic experienced something called tulip mania... Uh, the Dutch became obsessed with these flowers. This led many artists to create still llife paintings of different colored tulips The paintings were popular with wealthy paatrons because, um, tulips were incredibly expensive. So they were considered symbols of high status.

P : Um, and even though the popularity  of tulipss diminished over time, the demand for still life paintings stayed high... especially among the members of the upper classes. Dutch artists responded by producing works that appealed to these people... A common scene is tabletop decorated with items that only the wealthy could afford... gold and silver dishes, glass items, gourmet foods... things like that. A new trend also developed around this time. Um by today's standards, it's a little strangs... I'm talking about paintings of dead animals.

S2 : Dead animals? Why would anyone want a painting of that?

P : Well, hunting was a favorite hobby among the wealthy. And to remind them of successful hunts, they often hung the heads of dead animals on their walls... These paintings had the same functions. Nobleman say, the artists worked very hard to make these paintings appeal to hunters. Um, first of all... they added extra details to, well... to make the paintings more realistic. For example, the animals are posed specifically to look like they're just been killed. In addition, the paintings often depict the bodies of animals in their actual size. 

P : Um, this is particularly common for paintinga of small animals such as ducks... The result is a painting that creates the illusion of freshly killed animals hanging on the wall.
