Student-Centered Learning

Student-centered learning is an approach to education. If focuses primarily on the needs of students. Traditional approaches to education are largely driven by teachers and school administrators. However, student-centered learning recognizes the particular needs of individuals due to their distinct learning styles, interests, and abilities, Therefore, in student-centerd learning environments, the role of teachers in the classroom is to guide and assist rather than to direct and enforce. They are there to support students' independent learning.

OK. What I want to talk about is how the classroom experience can be more focused on the student... student-centered learning. To help you understand the idea, let's look at an experience my son had in high school a few years ago.

So, one semester my son's art class was studying classical art, and his art teacher gave an assignment ... The assignment was to create three art pieces based on famous classical paintings. Well, my son wasn't really interested in classical art, so he continued to delay starting his project even though the deadline was getting close.

You know, it's much harder to do any task that does not appeal to you and your interests. The teacher recognized this, so she decided to try soomething different. Uh, she tried a student-centered approach. So what did she do? She asked him to go online and find a type of art that interested him. Well, my son already knew what kind of art he liked. He was eager to work on comic book art and street art, so he decided to create pieces based on them. Anyway, because he was passionate about his topic, he worked really hard on his assignment. His work became some of the best that he'd made all year.

It even helped him win a scholarship to art school! And that's the sort of effect the student-centered approach can have. When students get to concentrate on what they actually like, it can really pay off in the end.
