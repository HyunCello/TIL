Well, let's suppose there's a personal trainer at a 24-hour fitness center. He works the night shift from, uh, let's say, six in the evening until midnight. He does this because the pay is higher in the evening ... Um, he makes $25 an hour and is happy with the money. But, he doesn't have time for a social life... For one thing, by the time work finishes, he's too tired to do anything because it's late at night. Plus, all of his friends work during the day, so it's hard to find a good time to meet.

Anyway, one night, his friends call and ask if he can make it to a movie. He would like to go because it's a movie he is really excited to see. So he decides to leave work three hours early to see the film. The trainer loses the chance to make $75 in the three hours he's not working... That's his opportunity cost... But he has fun with his friends and gets a break from work, so it's worth it to him because he values the experience more than he values $75... Does this situation sound faliliar to any of you?
