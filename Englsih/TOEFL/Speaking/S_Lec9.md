Assimilation(흡수, 동화) and Accommodation(합의, 협상, 적응)

When a person receives new information, a general idea is developed. If the person obtains other new information, he may simplify it to fit the idea. This is called assimilation. However, if the person cannot fit the information into the existing idea, accommodation occurs. To accommodate the information, the existing the idea is modified or a new idea is created. People develop their worldviews through assimilation and accommodation. These processes are often used to describe childhood development, but are also applicable in any learning situation.

All right ... assimilation is when we get new information and are able to fit it into an existing idea. Now, let's start by imagining a young child eating a peach for the first time. Assume he's eaten apples and oranges before... so he already has some idea about what "fruit" is. And his idea of fruit is anything that's uh, sweet and round. In the end, he quite easily assimilates the peach as, well, just another kind of fruit. It's easy for him because, uh, the two objects seem to naturally fit into the same category. Moving on ... Remember that accommodation is when an existing idea is changed because it it incompatible with new information. So let's say that one day, the child's mother gives him a banana-something he's never had before. It tastes sweet... but it's not round. Because he isn't sure what it is, he asks his mother. And she tells him that it is a fruit. Even though he originally believed that all fruits were round and sweet, he eventually understands that this belief i not correct. In other words, he accommodates this information, that, uh, a banana is a fruit too. He modifies his idea of fruit to include those that are sweet but aren't round.

According to the reading, assimilation is simplifying new information to fit the existing idea, and accommodation is modifying or creating an idea.

In the lecture, the professor uses an example to explain the two concepts, assimilation and accommodation.

She uses an example of a child eating a peach for the first time.

Since he's already eaten apples before, he has some idea about fruit, anything that is sweet and round. So, he easily assimilates the peach as fruit.

However, when the child is given a banana, which he's never eaten before, he needs to accommodate the new information because it's sweet but not round.

He does this by modifying the existing idea of fruit.
